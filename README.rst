BO4E Modification Proposals
===========================

Documents in this repository contain suggestions by Hochfrequenz on how to improve the `BO4E <https://www.bo4e.de>`_ standard.

How does this repository work?
##############################
The proposals are written in markdown files and stored in the `markdown folder <markdown>`_.
A `Github Action <.github/workflows/markdown_to_pdf.yml>`_ then automatically creates PDFs based on these markdown files. Click the little green checkmark ✔️ in the commit history, then click on "details" and download the most recent PDF from the actions "artifacts".
